This project was my first job experience straight out of college and I'm glad
this is the job I got. It had everything that I needed to learn and grow as a
developer. This is where I learned about UI automation with selenium, the first
time I ever used git and github, and the first time that I learned how to work
with a professional team.

I dove straight into UI automation learning about the page object model, how to
select elements, how to complete an End to End test, and how to review code.
From a QA perspective, I think the biggest take away that I got from this
project was learning when not to use automation.

Yes, automation is awesome in so many ways. It can save use time and redundant tasks,
add stability and confidence in the overall product but also add complexity and
maintenance overhead. It's important to weigh the benefits against the costs and
decide when automation is the right choice.

After realizing I can ask the question if this should be automated we started seeing
the benefits of automation. We were able to save time and reduce the number of
manual tests we had to run. We were also able to increase the stability of our
product by automating the tests that were most likely to fail.

Later on our automation testing started to shift left and more towards the
development process. We switched to typescript and playwright and BDD. This
allowed us to complete automation scripts within the sprints and got closure
to features shipping with proper testing.

## Features

- **Cross Browser Support**: Using Playwright allowed for cross-browser testing
(Chrome, Firefox, Webkit).
- **Screen shots and recordings**: This helped with debugging and troubleshooting.
- **Continuous Integration**: The tests were under the main project which
allowed for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Continuous Deployment**: This gave us higher confidence in the product and
reduced the time to market.

## Technologies

- **Playwright**: Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps
- **Typescript**: Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **BDD**: Behaviour Driven Development is a software development process that
encourages collaboration between developers, QA and business stakeholders.
